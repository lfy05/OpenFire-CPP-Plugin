This project contains the source code of an OpenFire (XMPP server by Ignite Realtime) plugin.  
It opens up a port and shares messages sent through the OpenFire server to this port.   
There is a companion C++ class that helps you write program in C++ to read these messages in your program.  

This plugin also features a management webpage accessible through OpenFire console under C++ SDK Integration where you can specify your connection parameters
